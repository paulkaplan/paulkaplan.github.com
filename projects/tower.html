    <h2>Tower Destruction</h2>
    <p>
      While I set out to make a game of jenga, trying to see if I could do the same thing with
      <a href="http://schteppe.github.com/cannon.js/">cannon.js</a> as they do with the <a href="http://chandlerprall.github.com/Physijs/examples/jenga.html">Physi.js example</a>
      , I ended up figuring out how to build the tower iteratively (hint: lay three, rotate, lay three... not to complicated!) then just
      having way more fun blowing up the tower with projectiles. So I give you, the new and improved Jenga game. 
    </p>

      It does not, of course, have a purpose. Or score. Or players. But you can shoot projectiles at a big tower and watch it explode, which is more than enough fun for me. 
      WebGL is dangerous for me because halfway through a project I often realize I have already built something more than fun enough to entertain myself, so I stop there and play with it all day.

      Controls are simple:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>click/drag to move the camera ( or hold 'a' and move mouse)</li>
        <li>hold 's' and move mouse to zoom</li>
        <li>hold 'd' and move mouse to pan</li>
        <li>shift + click -> shoot ball towards wherever the camera is looking, from the camera position</li>
      </ul>
    <p>This will only work on modern browsers (Chrome) with webGL enabled (Safari and Firefox support webGL but you may have to enable it).
